# JNBT-Java
A small Java package that provides functionality to access JNBT (Jacks Named Binary Tree) files and data, JNBT is based on Notch's orginal NBT specification but contains a number of key differences, as a result the NBT and JNBT format are not compatible. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> JNBT (Jack's Named Binary Tree) is not currently cross compatible with NBT (Notchian). Please see the specifications for full details.
